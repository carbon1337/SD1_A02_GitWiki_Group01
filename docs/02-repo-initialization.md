# Repository Initialization

This page will go over how to create a repository through Windows Terminal/GitBash

## Initialization

To bring a new project under control we must first initialize the repository (the repo)
from within the project's root folder:

To initialize a new git repo from the command prompt:
```
git init .
```

Git defaults to using the word "master" (as in "master copy" or "master recording") for
the main branch, but we can change this:
```
git branch -m main
```
