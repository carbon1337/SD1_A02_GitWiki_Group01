# Configuring a GitHub Remote
{: .no_toc}

A GitHub remote connects your local Git repository to a repository hosted on GitHub. This allows you to upload your changes, download updates, and collaborate with other programmers. This page explains how to create a remote repository, connect it to your local project, and verify that the connection works.

## What Is a GitHub Remote?

A remote is a reference to a repository stored somewhere outside your local computer. In this case, GitHub hosts the remote repository online.

Connecting a remote allows Git to know where to send your changes when you use commands such as `git push`. It also tells Git where to retrieve updates when you use `git pull`.

## Creating a Remote Repository

Before connecting your local repository to GitHub, you need a remote repository.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account.
2. Create a new repository if you haven't made one already.
3. Choose a name for your repository.
4. Create the repository.
5. Copy the repository URL from GitHub.

## Connecting Your Local Repository

Once you have copied the repository URL, you can connect it to your local repository.

Open a terminal in your project's folder and enter the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

Replace the example URL with your actual GitHub repository URL.

Here is what each part of the command means:

- `git remote` manages connections to remote repositories.
- `add` creates a new remote reference.
- `origin` is the name given to the remote. It is the common default name for the primary remote repository.
- The URL tells Git where the remote repository is located.

After running this command, your local repository will have a remote named `origin` pointing to your GitHub repository.

## Verifying the Connection

To check whether the remote was added successfully, run:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This command displays the configured remote repositories and their URLs.

A successful connection should display output similar to this:

```text
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (push)
```

The `(fetch)` entry shows the URL Git uses to retrieve changes. The `(push)` entry shows the URL Git uses to upload changes.

If your GitHub URL appears in the output, the remote has been configured.

## Common Issues

### The Remote Already Exists

If you receive an error stating that `origin` already exists, your local repository already has a remote with that name.

Use the following command to check your current remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

If you need to change the URL for the existing `origin` remote, use:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### The URL Is Incorrect

If the URL is incorrect, Git will not be able to connect to the intended repository. Copy the URL again from GitHub and check that it matches your repository.

### Permission or Authentication Errors

If Git reports an authentication or permission error when pushing or pulling, check that you are signed in correctly and have permission to access the repository. Private repositories require appropriate access.
